# Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview  
This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a **customer segmentation** pipeline using **K-Means clustering**. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on demographic and behavioral features—specifically **Gender**, **Age**, **Annual Income (k$)**, and **Spending Score (1-100)**—so that marketing strategies and resource allocation can be tailored to each segment’s characteristics.

---

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Provided file `Mall_Customers.csv`.  
- **Columns:**  
  - `CustomerID` (int): Unique identifier (dropped before clustering)  
  - `Gender` (string): “Male” or “Female”  
  - `Age` (int): Customer’s age in years  
  - `Annual Income (k$)` (float): Yearly income in thousands of dollars  
  - `Spending Score (1-100)` (int): A score assigned by the store based on customer behavior and spending patterns  

> **Note:** Ensure there are no missing values or obvious data-entry errors before running the segmentation pipeline.

---

## Prerequisites  
1. **Python 3.8+**  
2. Install the following Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
````

## Installation & File Structure

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the provided `Mall_Customers.csv` file in the project’s root directory.
3. The repository should have this structure:

   ```
   ├── Mall_Customers.csv
   ├── segmentation.py
   ├── README.md
   └── requirements.txt
   ```
4. (Optional) If you use a `requirements.txt`, include:

   ```
   pandas
   numpy
   scikit-learn
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. **Inspect the script**:

   * `segmentation.py` contains all code steps for loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualizing results.

2. **Run the clustering pipeline**:

   ```bash
   python segmentation.py
   ```

3. **Review generated outputs**:

   * An **Elbow Method** plot to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   * A **scatter plot** of **Annual Income vs. Spending Score** with each point colored by cluster.
   * A printed or displayed **cluster summary table** showing average Age, Income, Spending Score, Gender ratio, and count per cluster.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Initial Cleanup**

   * Read `Mall_Customers.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
   * Drop the `CustomerID` column (not informative for clustering).
   * Encode `Gender` to numeric values:

     * `Male → 0`
     * `Female → 1`
   * Check for nulls and outliers; handle or remove as needed (not included by default).

2. **Feature Scaling**

   * Use `StandardScaler` to normalize all features to zero mean and unit variance.
   * Rationale: K-Means relies on Euclidean distance, so features on different scales can distort clustering.

3. **Determining Optimal Number of Clusters** (Elbow Method)

   * Compute **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** for `k = 1` to `k = 10`.
   * Plot WCSS vs. `k` and identify the “elbow” where adding clusters yields diminishing returns.
   * Select that `k` (in this project, **k = 5**) as the final number of clusters.

4. **K-Means Clustering**

   * Instantiate `KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)`.
   * Fit on the scaled data and predict cluster labels.
   * Append a new column `Cluster` to the original DataFrame.

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**

   * Create a **2D Scatter Plot**:

     * X-axis: `Annual Income (k$)`
     * Y-axis: `Spending Score (1-100)`
     * Hue: `Cluster` label
   * Generate a **cluster summary** by grouping on `Cluster` and calculating average values for `Age`, `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`, and average `Gender` encoding (to gauge male/female ratio), as well as count of records per cluster.

6. **Cluster Profiling**

   * Use summary statistics to label each segment (e.g., “Young High-Spenders,” “High-Income Low-Spenders,” etc.) and guide targeted marketing actions.

## Example Outputs

1. **Elbow Plot**

   ```text
   Elbow Method Plot indicates k = 5 as the optimal number of clusters.
   ```

   > The “elbow” around 5 suggests that five distinct customer segments capture most of the variance.

2. **Cluster Scatter Plot**

   ```text
   A scatter plot showing Annual Income (x-axis) vs. Spending Score (y-axis), with points colored by cluster 0–4.
   ```

3. **Cluster Summary Table**

   ```text
   Cluster | Count | Gender (mean) | Age (mean) | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0       | 55    | 0.00          | 28.35      | 60.80              | 68.65
   1       | 40    | 1.00          | 28.25      | 62.00              | 71.68
   2       | 43    | 0.00          | 48.72      | 46.19              | 39.67
   3       | 31    | 1.00          | 55.90      | 48.77              | 38.81
   4       | 31    | 0.55          | 40.42      | 90.00              | 15.74
   ```

   * **Interpretation of “Gender (mean)”**:

     * Values near 0 → predominantly male
     * Values near 1 → predominantly female

## Cluster Profiles (Based on Averages)

* **Cluster 0** (55 customers)

  * All male, average age ~~28, mid-range income (~~\$60k), high spending (\~69).
* **Cluster 1** (40 customers)

  * All female, average age ~~28, mid-range income (~~\$62k), very high spending (\~72).
* **Cluster 2** (43 customers)

  * All male, older (~~49), lower-to-mid income (~~\$46k), moderate spending (\~40).
* **Cluster 3** (31 customers)

  * All female, oldest group (~~56), lower-to-mid income (~~\$49k), moderate spending (\~39).
* **Cluster 4** (31 customers)

  * Mixed gender (\~55% female), middle-aged (~~40), highest income (~~\$90k), very low spending (\~16).

Use these insights to inform marketing strategies, promotions, and personalized offers.

## Next Steps & Extensions

* **Feature Enrichment**: Add customer tenure, purchase frequency, or recency to refine segments.
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: If more features are added, apply PCA to reduce dimensions before clustering.
* **Alternative Clustering Algorithms**: Experiment with Hierarchical Clustering or DBSCAN.
* **Cluster Labeling**: Develop descriptive personas for each cluster (e.g., “Young Bargain Hunters”).
* **Real-Time Segmentation**: Wrap the pipeline in an API (Flask/FastAPI) to assign new customers live.
* **Dashboarding**: Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit, Power BI, or Tableau) to explore segments and key metrics.
